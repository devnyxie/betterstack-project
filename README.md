## Description
This is a very simple one-page application consisting of a single table and a form for creating new rows. To make it a little more complicated, we have written a 'framework' you have to use. Below is a set of simple tasks to perform. Please write a production-ready code.

## Installation ‚öôÔ∏è
### Database
1. Connect to MySQL:
```bash
$ mysql -u root -p
```
2. Create a new MySQL database:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE `php_test_project`;
```
3. Import `database/schema.sql` into your database:
```bash
$ mysql -u root -p php_test_project < database/schema.sql
```
### Application
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `composer install` to install dependencies.
3. Database credentials: Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and update the database credentials.
4. Run `php -S localhost:8000` to start the built-in Development Server.

## Tasks to perform
1. Style the page using [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) or [Tailwind](http://tailwind.com/) 
  * Every other table row should be highlighted. <strong>[done]</strong>
  * Use Bootstrap‚Äôs form-horizontal or equivalent to style the form. <strong>[done]</strong>
  * Please make any other styling changes based on your preferences to make the interface look presentable. <strong>[done as much as bootstrap 3.0.0 allows]</strong>
2. Add a validation of new records. <strong>[done]</strong>
3. Create a JS functionality to filter rows by city. <strong>[done]</strong>
4. Implement submission of the form using AJAX. <strong>[done]</strong>
5. Add a phone number column to the table. <strong>[done]</strong>
6. Please deploy the project to any freehosting and send us the production link. <strong>[done]</strong>

## Other Changes Made 
Apart from all the tasks mentioned in the instructions, I have also:
- Removed the short open tags from the code in views/index.php because they are not recommended according to the PHP documentation and require manual enabling in PHP 8.3.8.
- Switched to using Environment Variables for security reasons and easier deployment, as you requested for production-ready code.
- Previous import paths caused issues in the Docker container (different root path). I've updated them for a smoother experience.

## Notes
- I've kept and utilized all base dependencies, nothing was updated since it's a `Legacy` test project and in the real life scenario I would had to discuss it thoroughly with the team before making any changes.
- Minimal changes were made to the existing Framework's code. I've only added the necessary code to fulfill the tasks and make the application production-ready.
  * Phone numbers related changes.
  * Removed short open tags.
  * Updated import paths (for Docker).
  * Switched to using Environment Variables.

## Deployment Information
The project is currently deployed on Heroku, with the MySQL database residing on Railway. Ideally, a unified hosting solution would have been preferred, with Railway being the primary choice. However, due to limitations in their PHP support, this was not possible.

Thank you for the opportunity to work on this project. I hope you like it! <3
